The human brain is at its happiest peeling away at the layers of abstraction masking the faint lines of logic and reasoning that connect every question to an answer in this universe.

The internet, in my opinion, is an invention, whose relevance in today's world, is second to almost none. It is akin to that which electricity and the telephone had in the 19th century and early 20th century, when they turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life. For me, the internet has been the greatest enabler in my searches. This blog will be an attempt to outline my understanding of all that I learn in my encounters with technology and a reflection of the process that drives the "Clockwork Orange".
