I (Ritwik Roy) am a web developer and programmer from Calcutta, India and have been in the Information Technology industry for a little over three years. I currently work with Tata Consultancy Services, a leading multinational IT Services Provider, as a Systems Engineer.

As a developer, my primary focus has been the Microsoft technology stack which includes C#, ASP.Net, WCF, Entity Framework, WCF Data Services and ASP.Net MVC. Other areas of expertise include HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Oracle (PL/SQL). That aside, at a personal level, I have an interest in front-end engineering and design. I have also done preliminary work in Django (Python) and Node.js.

I enjoy reading, programming, music and writing. I appreciate art. As a hobby, I collect trade paperbacks and print editions of comics and graphic novels and build computers. I am an avid computer gamer.
